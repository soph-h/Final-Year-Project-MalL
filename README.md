## This repository contains code and visualisation files from D-NEMD analysis of MalL.  

The *dnemd.ipynb* notebook contains all the code used to set up and run the initial D-NEMD simulations.  
The *null_simulation_and_analysis.ipynb* notebook contains all the code used to run the null perturbation and the subtraction of the null perturbation from the D-NEMD simulations.  
The *.py* files are called within these notebooks.  
The *.pse* files are PyMOL visualisations of the results at both significance levels with '_dnemd' being the results from the simulations themselves while '_null_dnemd' is the results from the subtraction of the null perturbation from the D-NEMD simulations.
